# Aircraft Takeoff Simulation

This repository contains a Python-based aircraft takeoff simulation program. It allows users to simulate the takeoff of an aircraft by considering various physical parameters and motor data.


## Features

- Numerical simulation of aircraft takeoff.
- Analytical verification of takeoff velocity.
- Plotting of forces, accelerations, and more.


## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12
- Required Python packages (install using `pip install numpy scipy matplotlib Tkinter`)
  

## File Structure

- `acceleration.py:` Update acceleration based on equations of motion.
- `aircraft.py:` Store variables of the aircraft.
- `constants.py:` Store constants used in the simulation.
- `energy.py:` Calculate kinetic energy.
- `physics.py:` Calculate forces on the aircraft.
- `main.py:` Main application with a graphical user interface.
- `motors.py:` Motor data and thrust calculation.
- `plot.py:` Functions for plotting results.
- `simulation.py:` Simulate the takeoff process.
- `verification.py:` Analytical verification of takeoff velocity.
